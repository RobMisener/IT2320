## IT 2320 – Lab 2

In this lab, we’ll take a first look at JavaScript development.  

*Instructions:*  
1.	Create a folder called Lab02 in the root of your class repository – IT2320[FirstInitial][LastName]/Lab02.  Note: you can create the folder and files using Visual Studio Code.  
2.	Create an HTML file called Lab02.html. Add a header to the page that says “Grocery Shopping Cost Calculator”.   
3.	Write code that prompts a user to add grocery item cost.  Have the prompt default to a value of 1 and prompt the use with the following message – “Please enter the cost of your next item”. Parse the user’s entry into an integer value.   
4.	Declare a variable for costSum with a starting value of 0.  Code a for statement that calculates the sum of the numbers.  This statement should use a counter variable with a starting value of 1, it should execute as long as the counter variable is less than or equal to the value of the user entry, and it should increment the count variable by 1 each time through the loop.   
5.	Add an alert statement after the for statement that displays the calculated sum. [1 point]
6.	Add an if statement that validates the user entry.  This statement should check if the entry is not a number, if it is less than 1, or if its greater than 100.  If any of these conditions are true, it should display an appropriate error message.   
7.	Add a while statement that will continue prompting the user for an entry and displaying an error message until the entry is valid.   
8.	Add a display to display the results so it read: “The total cost of your groceries is current “ + costSum.   
9.	Make sure to Commit and Push your new folder and files to github.
10.	Submit the path to your github repository folder..  You do not need to upload any files.
