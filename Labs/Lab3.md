## IT 2320 – Lab 3

In this lab, we’ll write our first JavaScript application. 

*Instructions:*  
1.	Create a folder called Lab03 in the root of your class repository – IT2320[FirstInitial][LastName]/Lab03.  Note: you can create the folder and files using Visual Studio Code.  
2.	Modify the grocery cart app from lesson 2, so that it stores the item descriptions and costs in separate arrays. After all of the inputs are complete, use a loop to display the items and calculate a total before tax, total tax amount, and total after tax. You can reuse the display from the previous lab.
3. Add a discount! Add the description to the top of the page, "Money Back Offer! Get increased savings: $10.00 saves $1.00, $20.00 saves $2.00, and $50.00 ore more saves $5.00." Then make sure the savings are applied before taxes.  
Again, if the cost is more than $10.00 add a $1.00 discount. If the price is more than $20.00 add a $2.00 discount. If the price is more than $50.00 add a $5.00 discount.  
Display the savings in your receipt summary.
4. Double-check to make sure all of your latest changes are pushed successfully to GitHub.
5.	In Blackboard, submit the path to your github repository folder.  Please do not upload any files.
