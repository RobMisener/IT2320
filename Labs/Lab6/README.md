In this lab, we'll practice interacting with the DOM

*Instructions:* 
1. Add the value of newAmount to the running total totalAmount. Tip: Use parseFloat()
2. Concatenate the value of Item Description into the table. Change item to the value of itemDescription
3. Display totalAmount in element with id="totalAmountBeforeTax"
4. Calculate tax as 7% of total (totalAmount)
5. Display tax in element with id="totalTax"
6. Display totalAmount + tax in element with id="totalAfterTax"
7. Display all currency values that are output to display 2 decimal places. Hint: use toFixed()
8. Add a checkbox to indicate whether or not the customer is a member. If the user checks the box, add a line giving them a 3% discount. You will need to add the required html to display it as well.
